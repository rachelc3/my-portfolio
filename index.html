                        Hello! My name is Rachel, I’m from Massachusetts, and I’m looking for a job in front-end web development. 
                        Front-end web development bridges the gap between design and functionality, ensuring seamless user experiences across different devices and browsers. 
                        With my eye for detail and my coding knowledge, I can create beautiful, functional websites and would be a valuable asset to any organization. 
                        I’ve always been interested in computers, and I was around 14 years old when I was introduced to my first coding language. It intrigued me and in 2022 I finally realized I wanted to do this as a career. 
                        After working in retail on and off for the past few years, I’m ready for a change. When I am not coding, you can usually find me reading or 
                        watching anything true crime related.
