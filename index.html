                        Hello! My name is Rachel, I’m from Massachusetts, and I’m looking for a job in front-end web development. 
                        Front-end web development bridges the gap between design and functionality, ensuring seamless user experiences across different devices and browsers. 
                        With my eye for detail and my coding knowledge, I can create beautiful, functional websites and would be a valuable asset to any organization. 
                        I’ve always been interested in computers, and I was around 14 years old when I was introduced to my first coding language. It intrigued me and in 2022 I finally realized I wanted to do this as a career. 
                        After working in retail on and off for the past few years, I’m ready for a change. When I am not coding, you can usually find me reading or 
                        watching anything true crime related.

                    Notes can be edited, added, deleted, and search for via the search bar, with all of the notes saved to local storage.<br>
                    The main skills and coding languages used to build this are ES6, JSX, Managing data flow, and DOM Manipulation.
